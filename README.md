  > ## DESCRIPTION
As a new developer, learning how to build an API for a social network web application using MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose is a valuable opportunity. MongoDB's speed and flexibility make it ideal for handling large amounts of data and unstructured content, crucial for social networks. 

I will explore technologies commonly used in full-stack social networking platforms, emphasizing data as the foundation of these applications. Development steps involve creating an API that enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. Mastering these technologies will empower me to contribute effectively to modern social network development.
